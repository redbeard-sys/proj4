Every program has a stack of functions that it executes. The stack contains variables of local functions. A hacker looks for functions in a code base that have return instructions. These are called gadgets. Gadgets, arbitrary return functions, are then chained together in a way that will overflow the stack buffer. Once the stack is overun the hacker can make system calls, and make requests to the kernal. Through system calls can invoke a payload (malicious code). In order for a better understanding of ROP attacks, one should have a elementary understanding of machine code and decompiliers like GNU Project Debugger(gdb). </p>","          <div class=\"rop-images\">","          <img class=\"overflow-img\" alt=\"buffer-overflow pic\" src=\"images/buffer-overflow.jpg\" width=\"480\"","             height=\"199\">","             <img class=\"anon-img\" src=\"images/anon.jpg\" alt=\"anonymous\" width=\"480\" height=\"199\">","  </div>","    </div>","","    <div class=\"item embed-responsive embed-responsive-21by9\">","<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XZa0Yu6i_ew\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","</div>"],"id":5}],[{"start":{"row":7,"column":40},"end":{"row":7,"column":46},"action":"remove","lines":["images"],"id":6},{"start":{"row":7,"column":40},"end":{"row":7,"column":41},"action":"insert","lines":["i"]},{"start":{"row":7,"column":41},"end":{"row":7,"column":42},"action":"insert","lines":["m"]},{"start":{"row":7,"column":42},"end":{"row":7,"column":43},"action":"insert","lines":["g"]}],[{"start":{"row":5,"column":67},"end":{"row":5,"column":73},"action":"remove","lines":["images"],"id":7},{"start":{"row":5,"column":67},"end":{"row":5,"column":68},"action":"insert","lines":["i"]},{"start":{"row":5,"column":68},"end":{"row":5,"column":69},"action":"insert","lines":["m"]},{"start":{"row":5,"column":69},"end":{"row":5,"column":70},"action":"insert","lines":["g"]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":5,"column":70},"end":{"row":5,"column":70},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":29,"mode":"ace/mode/html"}},"timestamp":1586147097800,"hash":"37d7df4ddc1d16fbf6f3bb2a07d663ed91c7b2ff"}
